# Social-Network_API

# Description
This app allows you to user create users, and create thoughts and reactions to friends. The application right now only allows you to create username and add email. Could not full function the thoughts where I would add it with id and username. I created the api for users using insomnia. I also tried to use momnet to create the time frame when the thought was created.
